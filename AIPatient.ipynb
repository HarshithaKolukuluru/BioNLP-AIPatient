    "                        - If an entity is mentioned in the discharge summary but clearly denied (e.g., \"no fever\", \"no history of asthma\"), ensure it is correctly labeled with `\"negated\": true`.\n",
    "                        - Ensure \"Family Medical History\" contains only valid conditions (no duplicates or invented terms).\n",
